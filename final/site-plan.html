      </ul>
      <h3>Choose a Brand</h3>
      <p class="choose">Picking a brand of snowmobile may be tricky. With so many new advancements in technology and the way that each snowmobile brand competes, you cannot really make a wrong choice. With all that being said, different brands may fit your riding style a little better than others. Lets take a look.</p>
      <h4>Polaris</h4>
      <p class="polaris">Polaris is a great snowmobile manufacturer with powerful, reliable engines, and many models to choose from. Their mountain sleds are compact and robust, and deliver plenty of power to the track. They come with four different engine options, depending on the model, being; Patriot Boost, Patriot 9R, 850 Patriot, and 650 Patriot. Polaris Snowmobiles are known to be able to keep a steady line while side-hilling, allowing the rider to maintain better control of the machine. If you like to catch some air, a Polaris is great for stability and control, even mid-jump. You cannot go wrong with a Polaris Snowmobile.</p>
      <h5>Ski doo</h5>
      <p class="Skidoo">Ski doo has dominated the snowmobile game for a while. With constant breakthroughs of technology and power, they have always been a step ahead in innovation. There are plenty of models to fit any of your needs, from trail riding, to mountain climbing. With their new, factory built 850 Turbo R engine, there is nowhere you can not go. With a recently new platform, It makes controlling that sidehill so much easier. With the narrower stance, it allows you to be in complete control under those gnarly conditions. You will not regret buying a Ski doo snowmobile.</p>
      <h6>Arctic Cat</h6>
      <p class="arcticcat">Arctic Cat is another great snowmobile brand. With slightly fewer options, Arctic Cat really dials in with what they have. With newer technologies and a one-of-a-kind rear mono rail system, They can keep up in any group. New for this year, they have produced a more powerful, and quicker engine than ever before at Arctic Cat.</p>

      <h3>Tips and Tricks for Backcountry Riding</h3>
      <h4>Sidehill</h4>
      <p class="sidehill">Sidehilling is a necessary skill when exploring the backcountry. To understand this, you must also understand what a countersteer is. Countersteering is turning your skis the opposite way that you want to go. No matter what brand of snowmobile you are riding, while in deep snow, they are all made to lean the opposite way that you are turning your skis. You can use this to your advantage. When finding yourself on the side of a hill, you want to put your weight on the side of the machine that is facing uphill. If the hill was to your left, you would put your right foot on the left running board, and hang your left foot out towards the snow, and vice versa. Once you are in that position, you turn your skis towards the downhill side. Although it feels wrong, this will help lean your snowmobile a little bit uphill. Once that happens, you need to pull the handlebars over and balance your sled on the hill. Once you have mastered this skill, you can get almost anywhere.</p>
      <h5>Hop Over</h5>
      <p class="hopover">A hop over maneuver can come in handy in sticky situations, but it is also just a fun way to ride. You will begin on a sidehill, on a hill that is not too steep, but steep enough to bring the nose of your machine up when needed. You will head direction in a diagonal line of the hill fairly slowly. You want to save some acceleration for the hop over. Once you find where you want to do it, you hit the throttle which will force the nose up in the air. Once that happens, you pull the machine back over towards the direction you came from. While the machine turns around, it will whip the tail end of your machine around, giving you a little boost to hop from one side of your machine to the other. After you hop over and land on the opposite running board, you will continue your line up the hill.</p>
      <h6>Bowtie</h6>
      <p class="bowtie">The bowtie is similar to the hop over, but instead of hopping over and changing direction, you continue going the same direction. For this move, you will start on a sidehill, and just like with the hop over, you want to save some throttle for your move. Once you find the area where you want to do it, you will hit the throttle and pull the machine over and then downhill. As soon as the machine starts turning uphill, you need to turn and look downhill at where you want to land and which line you want to take after you land. The machine will follow your head and rip around until it lands on its side in the snow, facing the same direction that you were going.</p>
