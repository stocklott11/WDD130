                <h3>How should I prepare for my trip?</h3>
                <p>As you may have guessed, when you go rafting, you are going to get wet! That means that you need a way to keep you belongings dry. When rafting with Dry Oar, we will provide you with one large size dry bag for your camping gear. You will be allowed to bring an additional dry bag of your own for any other items you would like to bring. If you are afraid of ruining something important, don't bring it! You will want to wear clothes that dry easily, and sandals that are close toed, but allow water to escape from them. Make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen and sunglasses with chums. If you have any other questions, reach out to us on any of our social media accounts.</p>
